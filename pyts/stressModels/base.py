             correlations can exceed one if they overlap. However,
             their are limits to the overlap. This criteria indicates
             that limit has been exceeded.
          2) The 'sign' criteria. If only one component is negative
             than they can not overlap. In this case the sum of
             magnitude of the correlations must be less than 1.

        If any of the criteria are false at any point, than the
